## Introduction

We introduce you to the **coolest community hodling pool** on _Ethereum- HodlTogether_, which is a _spicy amalgamation_ of the **Defi**, **NFTs** and **NGOs**. HodlTogether uniquely incentivizes the users to _Hodl_ their tokens which can be of any type such as _LINK_, _ZRX_, _BAT_, _SRX_, etc. for a long period of time. By doing so, they also contribute to the betterment of society and community development, as they donate a certain amount of their _Hodled tokens_ to the **NGO** associated with the _Hodling pool_.
